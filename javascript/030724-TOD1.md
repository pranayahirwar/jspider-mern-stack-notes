# Closures

When a function (inner) defined inside another function (outer) **closure** concept come into picture, all the **variables, function, object** which are defined inside **outer function** will be accessible to **inner function** even if **outer function execution is completed**, but only if we are saving outer function returned value in some variable, otherwise, we can't call inner function.

```js
function outer() {
  let someVar = "10"
  function inner() {
	// CASE 1:
    console.log("inner")
	// CASE 2:
	console.log(someVar)
  }
  return inner;
}

let x = outer();
x()
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Look at CASE 2: Let's assume, we have commented in CASE 2: `console.log(someVar) `so this mean, we are not accessing `someVar` variable from **outer function** inside **inner function**, but then also JSE will use closure and save someVar value inside
