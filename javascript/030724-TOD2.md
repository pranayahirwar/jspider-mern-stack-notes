# `this` Keyword

- `this` is a keyword in JS, which will be created for **execution context**.
- `this` keyword value is assigned at runtime when execution context is created, because `this` is one of the property of execution context.
- In global execution context, `this` refers to `window` object
- In regular **function declaration** or **function expression**, when function is called, `this` keyword refers to `undefined` in `strict mode` else it points to `window` object in `non-strict` mode
- Arrow Function does not have it's own `this` keyword, If we use `this` in Arrow Functions then `this` keyword will refers to the value of it's parent's scope or it's parent execution context object, in which `this` keyword value is defined

> [!TIP] 
> `this` keyword value table. Remember, [`this` Keyword in Object](#`this`%20Keyword%20in%20Object), `this` keyword behave little bit different when defined inside methods(), so refer below table too.

| Function Type        | NON-STRICT MODE                                            | STRICT MORE                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Function Declaration | window Object in<br>Browser                                | `undefined`                                                |
| Function Expression  | window Object in<br>Browser                                | `undefined`                                                |
| Arrow Function       | Refers to current lexical<br>environment, parent reference | Refers to current lexical<br>environment, parent reference |

```js
// #################################################
// # CODE WITH NON-STRICT MODE
// #################################################

// ---

// console.log(this); // Output: Refers to windows object `this` keyword, when runned in browser

// ---

}

// ---
let someFunction = function () {
  console.log(this);
};
someFunction(); // Output: Refers to windows object `this` keyword, when runned in browser

// ---
let someFunction = () => {
  console.log(this);
};
someFunction(); // Output: Refers to it's parent execution object, when runned in browser

console.log(this); // Output: Refers to windows object, when runned in browser

// ---
function someFunction() {
  console.log(this);
}
someFunction(); // Output: undefined

// ---
let someFunction = function () {
  console.log(this);
};
someFunction(); // Output: undefined

// ---
let someFunction = () => {
  console.log(this);

someFunction(); // Output: Refers to it's parent execution object's this keyword, when runned in browser
```

## `this` Keyword in Object

- `this` keyword work's a little bit different in method call (calling a function which is defined inside Object), `this` keyword points to object, on which method is called.
  Eg. For Above bullet point.

```js
let someObject = {
  1: "ONE",
  a: "A",
  someMethodOnObject: function () {
    // Function Expression, because we are saving this function expression in             someMethodOnObject

    console.log(this);
    // {
	//   '1': 'ONE',
	//   a: 'A',
	//   someMethodOnObject: [Function: someMethodOnObject]
	// }
  },
};

someObject.someMethodOnObject();
```

When we are calling a method like `someObject.someMethodOnObject()` If we are using `this` keyword inside `someMethodOnObject()` is written as **Function Expression (we can't use Function Declaration inside Object)** then `this` keyword is going to contain properties and methods defined inside `someObject`

**TABLE for `this` keyword value when defined inside object's method**

| Function Type        | NON-STRICT MODE                                             | STRICT MORE                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Function Declaration | refers to objected which called the method                  | refers to objected which called the method                |
| Function Expression  | refers to objected which called the method                  | refers to objected which called the method                |
| Arrow Function       | Refers to current lexical<br>environment parent's reference | Refers to current lexical<br>environment parent reference |
