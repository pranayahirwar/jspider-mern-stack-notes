# `this` Keyword

- `this` is a keyword in JS, which will be created for **execution context**.
- `this` keyword value is assigned at runtime.
- In global context, `this` refers to `window` object
- In regular **function declaration** or **function expression**, when function is called, `this` keyword refers to `undefined` in `strict mode` else it points to `window` object in `non-strict` mode
- Arrow Function does not have it's own `this` keyword, If we use `this` in Arrow Functions then `this` keyword will refers to the value of it's parent's scope or it's parent execution context object, in which `this` keyword value is defined

```js
// #################################################
// # CODE WITH NON-STRICT MODE
// #################################################

// ---

// console.log(this); // Output: Refers to windows object `this` keyword, when runned in browser

// ---
function someFunction() {
  console.log(this);
}
someFunction(); // Output: Refers to windows object `this` keyword, when runned in browser

// ---
let someFunction = function () {
  console.log(this);
};
someFunction(); // Output: Refers to windows object `this` keyword, when runned in browser

// ---
let someFunction = () => {
  console.log(this);
};
someFunction(); // Output: Refers to it's parent execution object, when runned in browser

// #################################################
// # CODE WITH STRICT MODE
// #################################################

// ---
console.log(this); // Output: Refers to windows object, when runned in browser

// ---
function someFunction() {
  console.log(this);
}
someFunction(); // Output: undefined

// ---
let someFunction = function () {
  console.log(this);
};
someFunction(); // Output: undefined

// ---
let someFunction = () => {
  console.log(this);
};
someFunction(); // Output: Refers to it's parent execution object's this keyword, when runned in browser

```

## `this` Keyword in Object

- `this` keyword work's a little bit different in method call (calling a function which is defined inside Object), this keyword points too object, on which method is called.
Eg. For Above bullet point.

```js
let someObject = {
  1: "ONE",
  a: "A",
  someMethodOnObject: function () {
    // Function Expression, because we are saving this function expression in someMethodOnObject

    console.log(this);
    /**
     * {
        '1': 'ONE',
        a: 'A',
        someMethodOnObject: [Function: someMe
      thodOnObject]
      }
     */
  },
};

someObject.someMethodOnObject();
```

 When we are calling a method like `someObject.someMethodOnObject()` If we are using `this` keyword inside `someMethodOnObject()` is written as **Function Expression** then `this` keyword is going to contain properties and methods defined inside `someObject`
