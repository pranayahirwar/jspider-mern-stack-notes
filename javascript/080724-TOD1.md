# Pure Function

A function which follow below points are known as pure function
- function should produce same output if same parameter is passed to it again and again.
- Pure function doesn't modify the state(**parameters & variable defined inside pure function** which we are passing to function)
- Function should not have any side-effect(pure function doesn't modify external data(**data outside function scope**))

```js
let y = 20 // f1 function is not modifying this outer variable, which statisfy 3rd point.
function f1(n1, n2) {
  let x = 10 // f1 function is not modifying this inner variable and passed argument, which statisfy 2nd point
  return n1+n2 // f1 function returning same output for same passed argument, which statisfy 1st point.
}
f1(2, 12)
```

# Impure Function

A function which follow below points are known as Impure function
- functions which not produce same output if same value is passed to function parameter again and again.
- Impure function could modify the state (state means **parameters & variable defined inside function**)
- Functions will have any side-effect (Impure function could modify external data(**data outside function scope**))

```js
let sum = 0 // f1 function is modifying this outer variable, which statisfy 3rd point.
function f1(n1) {
  sum += n1 // f1 function is modifying this inner variable and passed argument, which statisfy 2nd point
  return sum // f1 function returning same output for same passed argument, which statisfy 1st point.
}
console.log(f1(3)) // 3
console.log(f1(3)) // 6 different output is produced when we are passing same parameter, which satify 1st point.
```
