# Document Object Model

- DOM is a structured representation of HTML Elements as an **Object** which can also sometime called as **Tree**.
- When webpage is loaded in browser then the browser will create Object which contain every HTML elements defined inside HTML file as properties & methods and this Object known as `document`.
- Once the DOM tree is created, we can access elements from DOM tree or DOM Object by using JS to manipulate it.
- What we can do with `document` object
	- Add CSS styles
	- Update, remove, edit the content of currently selected HTML element using DOM
- `document` is an object which get's created when HTML file is loaded in browser
- `document` is a property of `window` object. (To access this `document` property of `window` object, we don't have to use `window.document` we can directly use `document`)

> [!TIP]
> - Document & DOM Tree is different???
> - DOM & BOM is different.

## Accessing HTML Elements using document Object

- `h1` html element (or elements which are written inside body element) is/are not present as property of `body` in `document` object.
- To access these element, we need to use methods
	- `getElementById("someID")`
	- `getElementsByTagName("h1")`
	- `getElementsByClassName("someClassname")`
	- `querySelector("someQuerySelector")` Eg: `document.querySelector(".someClass"); document.querySelector("#someID"); document.querySelector("h1");`
	- `querySelectorAll("someQuerySelector")`
- If we are using above methods to access html element, if it's not found, then above methods are going to return `null`

# Browser Object Model (BOM)

When we are accessing `window` object to manipulate Browser using JS, it's known as BOM
