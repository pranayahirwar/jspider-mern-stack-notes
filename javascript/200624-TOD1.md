# Break Statement

- Break statement can be used within looping statement or switch keyword, which is going to terminate loop
- Break statement is used to terminate the current loop or in which loop our `break` statement is written.

```js
for (let i=0; i <= 10; i += 1) {
	if (i%2 == 0) {
		break;
	}
	conosle.log(i)
}
console.log("Done");
// Output: 1 Done
```

# Continue Statement

> [!TIP]
> It's only used for Looping statement like, for, while, do while and others

- if `continue` statement is executed inside loop it will skip the current flow of loop and move to condition to check weather we are ok to continue our for loop or not.  

```js
for (let i=0; i <= 5; i += 1) {
	if (i%2 == 0) {
		continue;
	}
	conosle.log(i)
}
// Output: 1 3 4 5
```

## Return Statement

- **It can only be used within the function**
