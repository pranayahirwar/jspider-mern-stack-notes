# `switch` Conditional Statement

## Syntax

```js
// Although break keyword is not required, but we use most of the time iwth case part of switch conditional statement

switch(expression) {
 case expression:
  ...
  break // Note: break keyword is not required
 case expression:
  ...
  break // Note: break keyword is not required
 case expression:
  ...
  break // Note: break keyword is not required
 case expression:
  ...
  break // Note: break keyword is not required
 case expression:
  ...
 default:
  ...
}
```

> [!info] Note
> Remember to use `break` keyword inside **case** otherwise, for example let's say if case 2nd matches with the expression, then all the cases after 2nd will also execute including default value.

Q. Write a program using `switch` statement to print number of Days in month based on Month and Year input by user?

```js
let year = 2024;
let month = 6;

function isItLeapYear(n) {
  if (!(n % 400) || (!(n % 4) && n % 100)) {
    // either it should be divisible by 400 OR it should be divisible by 4 but not by 100
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

switch (month) {
  case 1:
  case 3:
  case 5:
  case 7:
  case 8:
  case 10:
  case 12:
    console.log("31 Days");
