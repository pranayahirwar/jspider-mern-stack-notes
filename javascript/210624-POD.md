Question: Write a program, weather given number is Perfect Number or not?

Answer: What is a Perfect Number -> Sum of all the factor of a number equals to the given number

```js
let n = 6;
let factorialSum = 0
for (let i=1; i<=Math.trunc(n / 2); i++) {
  if (n % i == 0) {
    factorialSum += i;
  }
}
console.log(factorialSum == n ? "Perfect Number" : "Not Perfect Number");
```

Question: Write a program, first 10 Fibonacci Series

Answer: Fibonacci Series, a series in which current number is decided based on the sum of last two number in the series, and series first and second number are 0 and 1 respectively

```js
let previousToPreviousNumber = 0,
  previousNumber = 1,
  numberOfFiboSeries = 10;
let tempVariable = 0;
if (n == 1) {
  console.log(0)
} else {
let output = fn + ", " + sn + ", ";
for (let i = 3; i <= numberOfFiboSeries; i++) {
  output += previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber + ", ";
  tempVariable = previousNumber;
  previousNumber = previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber;
  previousToPreviousNumber = tempVariable;
}
console.log(output);
}

```

Question: Write a program, to print Fibonacci Number for a given range?

Answer:

```js
let previousToPreviousNumber = 0,
  previousNumber = 1,
  start = 10,
  end = 20,
  tempVariable = 0;

if (end == 1) {
  console.log(0);
} else if (end == 2) {
	console.log(0, 1, 1);
} else {
  let output = "";

  // Here we have to use infinite loop, using for loop we can decalre infinite for loop in this two ways, for(;;); AND for(; true; );
  for (; true; ) {
    if (previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber >= start) {
      output += previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber + ", ";
      tempVariable = previousNumber;
      previousNumber = previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber;
      previousToPreviousNumber = tempVariable;
    } else if (previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber >= end) {
      break;
    }
  }
  console.log(output);
}


```

Question: Write a program, to check, given number is belongs to Fibonacci series or not?

Answer:

```js
let previousToPreviousNumber = 0,
  previousNumber = 1,
  tempVariable = 0,
  isItFiboSeriesNumber = 13;

if (isItFiboSeriesNumber == 1 || isItFiboSeriesNumber == 0) {
  console.log("Yes, it belong to Fibonacci Series");
} else {
  // Here we have to use infinite loop, using for loop we can decalre infinite for loop in this two ways, for(;;); AND for(; true; );
  for (let i=0; i <= 200; i++) {
    if (previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber == isItFiboSeriesNumber) {
		console.log("Yes, it belong to Fibonacci Series")
		break;
      
    } else if (previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber >= isItFiboSeriesNumber) {break;}
    else {
      tempVariable = previousNumber;
      previousNumber = previousToPreviousNumber + previousNumber;
      previousToPreviousNumber = tempVariable;
    }
  }
  console.log("Your Fibonacci Number is not present in TOP 200 Fibonacci Series");
}
```
