# Object

Object is an real world entity, which either contain 0 or multiple properties in `key:value` pair format and methods (functions).

> [!TIP]
> **Keys** in JavaScript objects are **strings or symbols** that act as unique identifiers for accessing the corresponding values associated with those properties. 

**In JS we can created object in two ways**
- Object Literal: `let obj = {key1: "value1", key2: "value2", ...}` or `let obj={}`. Note: Make sure to put values inside quote, if it's not a variable in JS code, if it's already defined variable in JS program then we don't have to use quotes
- Object Constructor: `new Object(someValue)`

**How to access properties in object**
- Dot (.) notation: `obj.key1` returns `value1`
- Bracket `[]` notation: `obj[key1]` returns value1, key1 should be in String format

> If we try to access property in object if it's not defined then a default value `undefined` is returned from object.

```js
let obj = {key1: "value1", key2: "value2"}
obj.key3; // undefined
obj.key3; // undefined
```

| If key defined in object contain space like this `"key one"` instead of `keyOne` then if we are trying to  access it using `.` then we can't access it.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | But we can access these types of keys from object like this `obj["key one"]` but make sure to pass key in `string`                                                       |
| We can't access values from object using dynamic input. Let's say `let v1="objectKey"` is variable already defined in program, and the value which v1 contain is one of the keys inside object, then if we try to access value of form object `obj.v1` we won't be getting expected result, because above code translates too, go search for v1 properties inside object, and not as, use value of v1 variable and key and search for this key | `obj[v1]` will first search for v1 variable in program (because we have not passed this values in string), resolve this value and then use this resolved value as key in |
| This notation can't be used, if key in object<br>`let obj = {1: "One"}`<br> are declared in `Number` datatype format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `obj[1]` will work.                                                                                                                                                      |
