Q. Write a program to print even number?

```js
let n = 10;
let i= n % 2 ? n : n+1;
for (; i <= 25; i += 2) {
  console.log(i)
}

// ANOTHER APPROACH TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM GENERAL POURPOSE FOR ANY VALUE OF N

function printEvenNumber(n, till) {
  let i = !(n % 2) ? n : n + 1;
  for (; i <= till; i += 2) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}

let nNumberArray = [10, 11, 12, 13];
nNumberArray.forEach((val) => {
  printEvenNumber(val, 25);
  console.log("===================");
});

```

Q. How to print 1 to 10 on same line?

let oneLineOutput = ""
for (let i=0; i<=10; i++) {
	oneLineOutput += i + ", ";
}
console.log(oneLineOutput);
```

Q. Write a program to find Factorial for given number?

```js
let n = 10;
let ans = 1;
for (let i=n; n > 0; i -= 1) {
  ans = ans * i;
}
console.log(ans)
```

Q. Write a program to print multiplication table for given number?

```js
let n = 2;
for (let i=0; i<=10; i += 1) {
console.log(`${n} * ${i} = ${n * i}`)
}
```

Q. Write a program to sum numbers from 1 to 10 or N digit?

```js
let n = 20, sum = 0;
for (let i=0; i<=n; i += 1) {
  sum += i;
}
console.log(sum);
```

Q. Write a program to check given number is Prime or not?

```js
let primeNumber = 9;

function isItPrimeNumber(val) {
	for (let i=2; i <= Math.trunc(val / 2); i++) {
		if (val % i === 0) {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}

console.log(isItPrimeNumber(primeNumber))
```

# Optimized Approach to Find Prime Number

An optimized algorithm to check if a number is prime focuses on reducing the number of divisions needed to determine primality. Here's a step-by-step explanation of an optimized approach:

1. **Handle Base Cases**: If the number is less than 2, it's not prime. Numbers 2 and 3 are prime.
2. **Check for Even Numbers**: If the number is greater than 2 and even, it's not prime.
3. **Square Root Rule**: You only need to test factors up to the square root of the number. If a number is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it's prime.
4. **Check Odd Factors Only**: Since even numbers are already ruled out, you only need to check odd factors.

```text
function isPrime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i from 3 to sqrt(n) by 2:
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
