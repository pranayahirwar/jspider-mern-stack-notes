# Strict Mode

To avoid magic of JS, we introduced Strict Mode

---

By using **strict mode** we can maintain secure JS code, which means we can avoid small mistakes done by developer.

Eg. without **strict mode**, this `someVar = "I am string"` will create variable even though we are not using variable keyword to declare variable. But if we are using strict mode using `"use strict"` directive, JS will give this error `ReferenceError: s is not defined`
