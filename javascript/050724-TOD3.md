# Hoisting

Hoisting is a default behavior in JS, which allows some of the variables and function to be used, before it's declaration. And to be used by I mean, JS is not going to give error if we are using some variable and function before it's declaration.

- variables declared using `var, let, const` are all hoisted, but if we are using variable `var` then JS is not going to give error if we are using `var` declared variable before it's declaration, otherwise JS is going to give error and our program is going to stop.

| let                                                                                                                                            | var                                                                                                                                  |

| let keyword is introduced in ES6 version                                                                                                       | it's first way of declaring variables in JS                                                                                          |
| let variables cannot be re-declared and re-initialized in current or same scope again. But if scope are different then we can                  | var variables be declared but it can be re-initialized in another scope                                                              |
| let variable are **blocked scoped**                                                                                                            | var variable are **function scoped**                                                                                                 |
| **let and const variables are also HOISTED but they are in TDZ** (Temporal Dead Zone)                                                          | var variables are also hoisted, and when accessed before declaration, it's going to return `undefined` keyword                       |
| if variables declared using `let or const` keyword, if it accessed before it's declaration then code is going to stop and give Reference Error | if variables declared using `var` keyword, if it accessed before it's declaration then code going to return undefined and won't stop |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When declaring variable using `const` then we have to assign value to declared variable, we can only do this `eg: const x = 10;` but can't `eg: const x;` this will give error

```js
// undefined, will be printed, but code will not stop
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;

console.log(c); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization
let c = 20;

console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
var z = 10;

const j; // Error: Missing initializer in const declaration

```

# TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)

TDZ is a time gap between `let` and `const` variable where hoisted to it's initialization, so when these variables accessed before it's declaration they are going to give error because they are in TDZ.

```js
console.log(a);
let a = 10;
```
