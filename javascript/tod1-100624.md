# Primitives Values in JS

1. **Primitives are represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.**

   This means that primitive types are the most basic data types in JavaScript and they are handled directly by the JavaScript engine. They are not objects and do not have methods or properties. Examples of primitive types are `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and `symbol`.

2. **All primitives are immutable; they cannot be altered.**

   This means that once a primitive value is created, it cannot be changed. For example, if you have a string `let str = "hello";`, you cannot change any character in that string directly. If you try to do `str[0] = 'H';`, it won't work. The original string remains unaltered. However, you can reassign the variable to a new value like `str = "Hello";`.

3. **Primitives have no methods but still behave as if they do.**

   This is a bit tricky. While it's true that primitives are not objects and do not have methods, JavaScript allows you to use methods and properties on them as if they were objects. This is because JavaScript automatically converts, or "boxes", the primitive to an object when you try to access a property or method. For example, if you have a string `let str = "hello";` and you do `str.includes('h');`, JavaScript temporarily converts `str` to a String object, calls the `includes` method on it, and *then discards the temporary object*.

4. **"mutating" primitives does not work**

   This is because when you try to assign a property to a primitive, JavaScript creates a temporary wrapper object, assigns the property to that object, and then discards the object. So the assignment has no lasting effect. For example, if you do `str.foo = 1;`, JavaScript creates a temporary String object, assigns `foo` to it, and then discards the object. So `str.foo` will be `undefined`.

Here's a code example to illustrate these points:

```javascript
let str = "hello"; // a primitive string
console.log(str[0]); // "h"
str[0] = "H"; // try to mutate the string
console.log(str[0]); // still "h", because primitives are immutable

console.log(str.includes('h')); // true, because JavaScript "boxes" the string to call includes

str.foo = 1; // try to assign a property
console.log(str.foo); // undefined, because the assignment was to a temporary object
```
