Question: Write a program, to print sum of digits in number?

Answer:
1. Write a for or while loop such that, it's going to run till number is not 0
2. Get the once digit of number
3. Update the number without last digit of number

```js
let sum = 0, givenNumber = 1234;

for (;givenNumber;) {
  sum += givenNumber % 10;
  givenNumber = Math.trunc(givenNumber / 2);
}
console.log(sum)
```

Question: Write a program, above program using while loop

Answer:

```js
let givenNum = 1242;
let sum = 0;

while (givenNum) {
  sum += givenNum % 10;
  givenNum = Math.trunc(givenNum / 10);
}

console.log(sum);
```

Question: Write a program, to count number of digits in given number?

Answer:

```js
let givenNum  = 4123;
let count = 0;
while (givenNum) {
  count += 1;
  givenNum = Math.trunc(givenNum / 10);
}
console.log(givenNum);
```

> [!NOTE]
> If datatype of giveNum is `String` then don't forget to use `String.length` property on givenNum

Question: Write a program, given number is Armstrong number or not?

Answer: What is Armstrong number, number whose each digits is multiplied X(number of digits in given number) amount of times by itself, and then added to sum var, which is going to keep total count of all the digit's in number after multiplication.
1. find the length of given number
2. then based on the length, then multiply each digit of given number by length of digit times
3. then compare if `sum === givenNum` return true else false

```js
let givenNum = 124;
let tempNum = givenNum;
let count = 0;

// STEP 01: FIND LENGTH OF NUMBER
while (tempNum) {
  count += 1;
  tempNum = Math.trunc(tempNum / 10);
}

// STEP 02: 
tempNum = givenNum;
let sum = 0;
while (tempNum > 0) {
	sum = sum + (tempNum % 10) ** count;
	tempNum = Math.trunc(tempNum / 10);
  }
if (sum === givenNum) {
  console.log("Yes")
} else {
console.log("No")
}

```

Question: Write a program, given number is Strong number or not?

Answer: What is a strong number? sum of each digit's factorial of a number should be equal to given number;
1. save the given number in `temp` var
2. take the **last digit** of the number
3. then find the factorial of that digit
4. save the factorial in `totalSum` var
5. then update the number
6. then compare the sum with `+`

```js
let givenNumber = 124;
let temp = givenNumber;
let sum = 0;
let lastDigit = 0;

while (temp) {
  lastDigit = temp % 10;
  let factorial = 1
  while (1 < lastDigit) {
    factorial = factorial * lastDigit;
    lastDigit -= 1;
  }
  sum += factorial;
  temp = Math.trunc(temp / 10);
}

if (sum === givenNum) {
  console.log("Yes")
} else {
console.log("No")
}

```
