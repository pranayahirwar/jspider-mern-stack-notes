# Function Overloading

Using a same function **name** to define multiple functions but with slight variation of function parameter count and parameter datatype (parameter datatype is not possible, because JS is not statically typed language) like

```js
f1(p1);
f1(p1, p2);
f1(p1, p2, p3);
```

so that different number of argument or different type of datatype is passed to function, correct defined function will be executed with matched parameter count and it's correct datatype is known as function overloading.

> [!TIP]
> In JS Function Overloading is not possible.
